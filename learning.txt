This is same task as previous JWT task but this time not using phalcon JWT but a 3rd party library
https://github.com/firebase/php-jwt . Use only "Example" code mentioined in repo readme

We need to use composer to install this library and then use its classes to CREATE and READ token
This time when you register/signup user then add custom data in jwt as follows
name
role
On validation page get role from this library and then check ACL
